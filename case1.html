      <h2>The Request</h2>
      <p>The email came from a collector who'd recently picked up an old book at auction—Machiavelli's <em>History of Florence</em>, with an 1854 publication date and an 1868 inscription on the inside cover. They weren't looking to sell it, just wanted to understand what they had and who might have owned it before.</p>
      <p>The message was refreshingly straightforward: <em>"Just looking to know more about it to be honest and came across your page that seems to offer something that might be useful for this."</em> Photos were attached, clear and well-lit.</p>
      <p>It's the kind of inquiry that makes the work enjoyable—someone genuinely curious about an object's history, asking the right questions, with no agenda beyond understanding. Makes everything go smoother.</p>

      <h2>The Investigation</h2>
      <p>The photos showed a half-leather Victorian binding with marbled boards and a gilt spine that had seen some wear over the years. Quality craftsmanship, mid-19th century work—this wasn't some throwaway edition. Someone had invested in making this book last.</p>
      <p>The publisher was <strong>Henry G. Bohn</strong>, a major London name in 1854. Bohn's "Libraries" series had a mission: making classics accessible to the growing Victorian middle class without sacrificing quality. History, philosophy, literature—all presented in affordable but respectable editions. This Machiavelli volume was part of that democratic vision, bringing Renaissance political thought to readers who might not have accessed it otherwise.</p>
      <p>The printer, <strong>J. Haddon & Son</strong> of Castle Street, Finsbury, had a solid reputation. Finsbury was a hub of London's printing trade during that era, full of workshops turning out everything from newspapers to fine editions. The binder remained anonymous, though likely another London firm working to similar standards.</p>

      <h2>The Inscription</h2>
      <p>The handwritten inscription—"Th. Pitts, Nov 12, 1868"—required some detective work of its own. Handwriting analysis and cross-referencing historical records suggested <strong>Thomas Pitts</strong>, likely an educated gentleman of the professional or clerical class living in the London area during the 1860s.</p>
      <p>The date was fourteen years after the book's publication, which told its own story. This wasn't a fresh-off-the-press purchase—more likely a gift, an inheritance, or perhaps just the day Mr. Pitts decided to formally claim it for his personal library. The full biographical details remained frustratingly out of reach, but the inscription itself added a human dimension: this book had been someone's treasured possession, valued enough to sign and date.</p>

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p>The timing of this edition matters. In 1854, mid-Victorian Britain was captivated by the Italian Risorgimento—the unification movement that was reshaping the peninsula through revolution and diplomacy. English readers weren't just interested in Machiavelli's famous <em>Prince</em>; they wanted his historical writings on Florence and Italian statecraft, seeing echoes of contemporary events in Renaissance politics. Bohn understood his market and published accordingly. The timing couldn't have been better.</p>

      <h2>The Findings</h2>
      <p>Three weeks of research, with updates sent along as new details surfaced. The final provenance report pulled everything together:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The publisher's history and significance (Henry G. Bohn)</li>
        <li>The printer and bindery context (J. Haddon & Son, Finsbury)</li>
        <li>Analysis of the Victorian binding and its condition</li>
        <li>The 1868 inscription and probable owner (Thomas Pitts)</li>
        <li>Contents: <em>The History of Florence</em>, <em>The Prince</em>, <em>The Affairs of Italy</em>, and related tracts</li>
        <li>Market comparisons and valuation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Valuation</h2>
      <p>Based on comparable sales, the book's condition (premium binding with moderate wear from honest use), and the strength of its provenance, the estimate came in around <strong>£20–£40</strong>. It could fetch more with the right buyer—someone collecting Victorian scholarship or specializing in Machiavelli—but that's the realistic range for a piece like this.</p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The client's response made it clear the investigation had hit the mark: <em>"I just needed a quick investigation into a book I acquired as I was interested in its past. I thought I'd try this supplier as a start and I was really impressed. Quick responses and the succinct report that was produced was exactly what I was looking for on this at a decent price."</em></p>
      <p>That's what good provenance work should do—take an object with an incomplete story and fill in the gaps. This book had traveled from a Victorian London publisher through a scholar's personal library during the height of Britain's fascination with Italian unification, and now the current owner understood that journey. Questions answered, history revealed, job done.</p>
