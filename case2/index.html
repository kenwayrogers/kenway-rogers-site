      <h2>The Client's Request</h2>

      <p>A family asked whether their relative, A. R. Galanides, had ever written a book on electrical fuses in the 1960s. Memory suggested a bound volume, but no title, publisher, or ISBN could be found in modern commercial catalogues.</p>

      <h2>The Investigation</h2>

      <p>Conventional bibliographic searches were performed across national and international library catalogues, academic databases, citation indexes, engineering publication lists from the 1950s–1960s, and digitised book collections. These searches confirmed technical publications by Galanides but found no commercial textbook or trade book under his name. Rather than stop there, the investigation reframed the question to consider how mid-century engineers circulated work; many outputs were issued as bound technical reports by research associations — standalone volumes, professionally bound, distributed to industry and libraries, and inconsistently catalogued.</p>

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>

      <p>Research uncovered several relevant outputs by A. R. Galanides, including journal articles and contributions to professional discussions. Crucially, a 1958 bound technical report co-authored by Galanides was located:</p>
      <p><em>The Effect of Filler Deficiency on the Performance of Cartridge Fuses</em> (co-authored by A. R. Galanides). Although labelled a "technical report," it was printed as a standalone bound volume, focused entirely on fuse technology, catalogued as a book in some systems, and published in the correct period — matching the family's recollection.</p>

      <h2>Interim Report — Mid‑Project Findings &amp; Next Steps</h2>

      <h3>Introduction &amp; Background</h3>
      <p>This is a halfway check‑in summarising what we have uncovered so far about Athos Renou Galanides (A. R. Galanides). He worked in the mid‑20th century on fuse performance and safety and appears to have contributed to the technical community around cartridge fuses and HRC fuse discrimination.</p>

      <h3>Confirmed Published Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1965 — <em>Some Experiments on Time‑Lag Fuses</em>, H. W. Baxter &amp; A. R. Galanides. Published in <em>Electronics and Power</em>. (https://digital-library.theiet.org/doi/10.1049/ep.1965.0210)</li>
        <li>1968 — <em>The Cult of D.C. and A.C. Circuits</em>, A. R. Galanides &amp; D. Longley. Published in <em>Electronics and Power</em>. (https://digital-library.theiet.org/doi/10.1049/ep.1968.0171)</li>
        <li>1958 — <em>The Effect of Filler Deficiency on the Performance of Cartridge Fuses</em>, H. W. Baxter &amp; A. R. Galanides. ERA Technical Report 308 — a bound monograph‑style report (the most likely match for the family's remembered "book").</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Additional Evidence</h3>
      <p>Galanides appears in printed discussion transcripts and IEE proceedings (showing active participation in professional debates). Example record: IEE proceedings/discussion (1960). (https://digital-library.theiet.org/doi/abs/10.1049/pi-a.1960.0103)</p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>If the objective is to confirm and obtain the ERA report, recommended actions are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Contact the IET Archives (highest priority) to request scans or holdings information.</li>
        <li>Contact the ERA Foundation (successor body) for records of ERA Technical Report 308.</li>
        <li>Request a manual search from the British Library for any uncatalogued science/industry holdings as a fallback.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>These steps should very likely locate a physical copy or a scan for the family.</p>

      

      <h2>Locating the Physical Copy</h2>

      <p>The report was not available online and circulated only within specialist engineering archives. Work then focused on identifying institutions holding physical copies, contacting archives, confirming shelf holdings, and requesting reproductions. This process produced a confirmed physical copy in a research library collection and scanned copies were obtained for the family.</p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>

      <p>The investigation reached a clear conclusion: no separate commercial textbook by A. R. Galanides appears to have existed. The remembered "book on fuses" was almost certainly a bound technical research report — identified, located, and recovered.</p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

      <p>This case shows how publications outside modern commercial norms can vanish from view, and how contextual historical research and archive liaison can recover them. Family memory was upheld, once publication practices of the era were understood.</p>

      <h2>Services Demonstrated</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Archival &amp; bibliographic research</li>
        <li>Academic database analysis</li>
        <li>Historical publishing context reconstruction</li>
        <li>Library &amp; archive liaison</li>
        <li>Evidence-based historical conclusions</li>
      </ul>
