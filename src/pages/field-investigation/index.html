          <h2>Field Investigation & On-Site Research</h2>
          
          <p class="lead">Not everything's in a database. Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to show up—dusty manor attics, municipal archives that still use card catalogs, archaeological sites where the real story's in the dirt. When the desk work runs out, I pack a bag.</p>

          <h3>What I Do in the Field</h3>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Site Surveys:</strong> On-location assessment of historical sites, ruins, and potential artifact locations</li>
            <li><strong>Estate Investigations:</strong> Cataloging and evaluating collections in private homes, attics, and storage facilities</li>
            <li><strong>Archive Deep Dives:</strong> In-person research at local historical societies, libraries, and municipal records</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Operations:</strong> Coordinating ethical recovery of artifacts from agreed-upon locations</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Photography, mapping, and detailed note-taking for origins records</li>
            <li><strong>Local Interviews:</strong> Speaking with community members, historians, and descendants who hold oral histories</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How I Approach Fieldwork</h3>
          <p>Every site's different, but the method stays the same:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Do the homework first.</strong> Maps, records, local contacts—know what you're walking into.</li>
            <li><strong>Work with locals.</strong> Landowners, historians, heritage officers. They know things you don't.</li>
            <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Photos, GPS coords, measurements. Memory's unreliable.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect the context.</strong> Ripping something out of the ground ruins the story.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't get killed.</strong> Proper gear, permits, risk assessment. Heroics are for movies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Where This Work Takes Me</h3>
          <p>Recent fieldwork has included:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Three days in Scottish highlands tracking down a ceremonial blade</li>
            <li>Manor house outside Prague with two centuries of unsorted family archives</li>
            <li>Abandoned Cold War bunker with military equipment no one cataloged</li>
            <li>Estate sale in Yorkshire—needed to evaluate 200+ items in six hours</li>
            <li>Small-town archive in Italy where nothing's been digitized and no one speaks English</li>
            <li>Coastal dive site for maritime recovery (with proper permits and a licensed team)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Equipment & Expertise</h3>
          <p>Field investigations require specialized tools and knowledge:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Metal detection and ground-penetrating radar (when appropriate)</li>
            <li>Photography and photogrammetry equipment</li>
            <li>GPS mapping and documentation tools</li>
            <li>Basic conservation supplies for fragile discoveries</li>
            <li>Knowledge of local regulations and permit requirements</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When You Need Field Investigation</h3>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>You've inherited a property with potential historical significance</li>
            <li>Historical records suggest artifacts in a specific location</li>
            <li>You need on-site evaluation of a collection or estate</li>
            <li>An origins gap requires physical investigation</li>
            <li>You're planning an ethical recovery operation</li>
            <li>Local archives need to be searched in person</li>
          </ul>
