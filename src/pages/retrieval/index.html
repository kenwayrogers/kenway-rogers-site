          <h2>Artifact Retrieval & Collection Services</h2>
          
          <p class="lead">You know what you're looking for. The problem is finding it. Rare pieces don't advertise themselves—they're in private estates, forgotten storage units, overseas dealers who don't do websites. I know where to look and who to ask.</p>

          <h3>Services Offered</h3>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Sourcing & Identification:</strong> Finding specific pieces or categories through private networks, auctions, and estate sales</li>
            <li><strong>Due Diligence:</strong> Full vetting of authenticity, origins, and legal status before purchase</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Representing your interests in private sales and competitive bidding environments</li>
            <li><strong>Collection Strategy:</strong> Advising on building cohesive, meaningful collections with long-term value</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Compliance:</strong> Ensuring all retrievals meet international standards and cultural heritage laws</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How I Find Things</h3>
          <p>Fifteen years of this work builds a network. I know people:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Estate liquidators who call me before the public sale</li>
            <li>Dealers in three countries who send photos of new inventory</li>
            <li>Collectors who'll part with duplicates—for the right offer</li>
            <li>Museum back rooms where deaccessioned pieces gather dust</li>
            <li>Heritage organizations that know when something's about to hit the market</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What I Won't Do</h3>
          <p>Some lines don't get crossed:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Looted material.</strong> If it was dug up illegally, I'm not touching it.</li>
            <li><strong>Stolen goods.</strong> Sketchy origins mean sketchy ownership down the line.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural patrimony violations.</strong> Some things belong to their source communities. Period.</li>
            <li><strong>Lying about gaps.</strong> If the history's incomplete, you'll know about it upfront.</li>
            <li><strong>Cutting corners.</strong> Every retrieval gets documented properly or it doesn't happen.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Who I Work With</h3>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Private collectors building specialized collections</li>
            <li>Museums seeking specific retrievals</li>
            <li>Academic institutions for teaching collections</li>
            <li>Families managing inherited collections</li>
            <li>Investors interested in tangible cultural assets</li>
          </ul>

            <p>Tell me what you're after. If it exists and it's findable, I'll track it down.</p>
